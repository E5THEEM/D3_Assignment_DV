                <h1>Overpopulation</h1>
                <p>
                    Overpopulation is a global problem with environmental, social, and economic issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is likely that by the year 2050, the world's population will double. The problem is not just running out of space, but the quality of life. 
                    The main concern is what can be done to solve the population problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This population explosion is responsible for most world environmental problems today such as;

                  <h1>Air Pollution</h1>
                  <p>
                    Poor air quality kills people. Worldwide, bad outdoor air caused an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016.
                    Over <strong>40</strong> percent of the population—are at risk of disease and premature death because of air pollution.
                    Particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers <strong>(classified as PM10 and the even smaller PM2.5)</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to overpopulation, there are a lot of vehicles on the roads which results in immense traffic; that also causes pollution. 
                    Smoke emitted from factories also causes great damage to the environment.

                  <p>
                    With enormous, cheap energy at its disposal, the human population grew rapidly from 1 billion in 1800 to 2 billion in 1930, 4 billion in 1975, and over 7.5 billion today. 
                    If the current course is not altered, we’ll reach 8 billion by 2020 and 9 to 15 billion by 2050.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So where does wildlife stand today in relation to 7.5 billion people? Worldwide, <strong>12</strong> percent of mammals, <strong>12</strong> percent of birds, <strong>31</strong> percent of reptiles, <strong>30</strong> percent of amphibians, and <strong>37</strong> percent of fish are threatened with extinction

                  <h1>Deforestation</h1>
                  <p>
                    Deforestation in turn leads to a reduced ability to capture CO2, thus exasperating the greenhouse gas problem. Human population increase is related to all of these deforestation pressures. More people means we need more food, more wood products, and more firewood. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Deforestation is strongly associated with loss of habitat and extinctions. 
                    Agriculture, as mentioned above, is responsible for about <strong>80%</strong> of global deforestation. 
                    Another <strong>14</strong> percent is attributed to logging, <strong>5</strong> percent to firewood collection, and the balance resulting from other causes.

                  <h1>Greenhouse Effect</h1>
                  <p>
                    Human population growth and climate change have grown hand in hand as the use of fossil fuels has exploded to support industrialized societies. 
                    Most fossil fuel consumption comes from developed countries. 
                    It is a sobering thought that most developing nations aspire to similar industrial economies as they experience economic growth, which further escalates CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As forests are cleared and burned, that CO2 is released into the atmosphere, accounting for an estimated <strong>25</strong> percent of total greenhouse gas production.
